<h2>Personal Statement</h2>     
          <article>
        
  <p>  Social Media can take you onto limitless heights because it constantly transforming the way we view things in society. The media along with hip-hop has really created a huge impact on our society. For example, “shout-outs” was introduced to America from African-Americans in the hip-hop world. To see President Barack Obama give a “shout-out” at one of his speeches was yet alone breathtaking. It was great to see our President in a more personal light rather than other presidents showing no character. President Obama gave America an informal side of him allowing us to see that hip-hop lives. That video alone went viral and social media help carry that message along to the younger crowd like me. One of Hip-Hops founder Russell Simmons, said that “social media is the new hip hop, the new rock and roll, the new equalizer, giving voice to the previously voiceless, the sound and thunder for social justice, the intimate forum for honest integration, which the new America yearns for.” With this new voice we as citizens should take advantage of the power social media has. We can now voice our opinions on many topics through social media! I hope that one day I can work with Coca-Cola Benefit Concerts because not only will I have the opportunity to help and encourage my community but I will be able to promote a great cause to citizens. I’ve been lucky to meet a few famous people in the entertainment industry like rapper ASAP Rocky, School Boy Q, and Kendrick Lamar. Working with the media combined with a great cause will give me the experience of a lifetime! </p>
