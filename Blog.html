            <p>Being that media and society is my major I started a blog entitled, <i>“Moth in a Flame,”</i> that explains the many ways we are drawn to media and how it affect our lives. </p>

<p>Throughout my blog you will find topics such as how women are viewed in the media, how the value of education is changing due to media and other ways that our society is heavily being influenced by the media. Media is around us every day!  If it’s not through radio station, it may be an Ad or even a television commercial that will subliminally influence our thought process and that is why I find media so amazing.
