            Hello! My name is Christina E. Carey and I am a junior at the<a href="http://www.ufl.edu" target= "_blank"> University of Florida</a> studying Telecommunications: Media & Society, which ranks as one of the top 10 universities for Journalism and Communications. I find myself drawn to social media, entertainment media, mass media, and all other sources of media because our society is constantly being shaped and influenced by it. I plan on becoming a Public Relations Practioner where I can utilize various forms of media along with my creativity to represent companies to our society. Studying Media & Society has given me an opportunity to take a further in depth look at how media may affect politics, teenagers, and our culture in todayâ€™s society.
 </p>
  <!--make UF clickable-->              
<p> My greatest aspiration in life is become an in-house public relations practioner at a corporation.I would love to combine my passion for the media along with communicating into my career. </p>            

<p> On this website, I have listed my previous work experience and activities. I wish to expand my accomplishments throughout the rest of my collegiate journey and gain valuable experience that will become beneficial to my professional career.</p>
